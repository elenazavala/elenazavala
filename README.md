### ✨ Hi there ✨

i'm Elena, a junior compSci student. I love igniting my creative self by turning science and technology into an art. 

I think that art is an essential investment in STEM and innovation, and I have always had a passion for creative practices such as dance, the movie & film industry, architecture and digital art. 
Crossovering these creative skills and passions with my love for technology, innovation, research and science is what I enjoy doing. I aim to be an exemplar of someone that is capable of merging the magic of computer science with their artistic avocations and creative passions ! 

I’m currently learning web development and game development, using React.js and Unity!
