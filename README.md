### Hi there âœ¨

I'm Elena, a Software Engineer from Paraguay ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¾ . I enjoy igniting my creative side by turning science and technology into an art, while merging the magic of computer science with creative, beautiful and unique productions. 

Sometimes science is more art than science ðŸ¤Ÿ

I think that art is an essential investment in STEM and innovation, and I have always had a passion/interest for creative practices such as the film and video game industry, digital art, paintings, dance, music and architecture. 

Currently trying to find new ways to crossover my creative skills  with my love for technology, research and science.
