### ✨ Hi there ✨

I'm Elena, a senior compSci student. I love igniting my creative side by turning science and technology into an art. 

I think that art is an essential investment in STEM and innovation, and I have always had a passion for creative practices such as dance, the film industry, architecture and digital art. 

Crossovering these creative skills and passions with my love for technology, innovation, research and science is what I enjoy doing. I aim to be an exemplar of someone that is capable of merging the magic of computer science with their artistic/creative avocations.
