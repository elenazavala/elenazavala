### Hi there 👋

i'm Elena, a compSci student from paraguay 🇵🇾 at KU! I ❤️ igniting my creative self by turning science and technology into an art. 
I think that art is an essential investment in STEM and innovation, and I have always had a passion for creative practices such as dance, the movie & film industry and digital art. I aim to be an exemplar of someone that is capable of merging the magic of computer science with their artistic avocations and passions

I’m currently learning web development and game development, using React.js and Unity!
