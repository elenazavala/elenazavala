### Hi there âœ¨

I'm Elena, a senior compSci student. I enjoy igniting my creative side by turning science and technology into an art. 

I think that art is an essential investment in STEM and innovation, and I have always had a passion/interest for creative practices such as dance, the film industry, digital art, paintings and architecture. 

Crossovering these creative skills and passions with my love for technology, innovation, research and science is what I enjoy doing. I aim to be an exemplar of someone that is capable of merging the magic of computer science with their artistic/creative avocations.
