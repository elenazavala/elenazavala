### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Elena, a compSci student from Asuncion, Paraguay at the University of Kansas! I love ðŸ”¥ igniting ðŸ”¥  my creative side by turning science and technology into an art. 
I think that art is an essential investment in STEM and innovation, and I have always had a passion for creative practices such as dance, the movie & film industry and digital art. My goal has always been to crossover my artistic avocations with my love for science and technology.
